The command below will compile the program

gfortran -o "rwimmacsv - V2" "\users\roger\documents\marine weather\rwimmacsv - V2.f90"

The command below will run the program and create a .csv file from an un-tarred and g-zipped archive

type "..\IMMA-MarineObs_icoads3.0.0_d201412_c20160608080000-sample.dat"|"rwimmacsv - v2" > "..\IMMA-MarineObs_icoads3.0.0_d201412_c20160608080000-sample.csv"

The ICOADS Homepage is here: http://icoads.noaa.gov/products.html and the data and documentation can be found here: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/marine/icoads3.0/ along with some documentation.

At this point this code will only process the core portion of the record however could be expanded to process the rest of the record.

This is placed on GitHub in the hopes it will assist another Researcher inthe future.
